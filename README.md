# AngularDemo

The goal of this app is to create a very simple demo.  The goal is to create a form which enables users to create, edit, update, and delete a pool game between two players.

The form should be able to list all of the games played between two players.  There are two primary routes.  The first route is `/player` and the second is `/games`.

The games path lists a bunch of different games.  The user can add, edit, or delete those games.

When updating a game, a valid score must be entered.

Deleting a game shows a confirmation box that asks the user to confirm.

The `/player` route allows the user to change the names of the two players.

The goal is to be a simple, yet still functionally useful app to test users against.  This branch is the final product of the demo.
