- Display the results of all the games.
- Add in a link to edit the result of a game.
- Add in a link that will delete the result of a game.  Bonus if you add some kind of confirmation to it as well, since this is a destructive operation.  There is a delete-dialog component for this purpose, but you do not have to use it.
